**Work Approach:**

This project uses a modern front-end development workflow centered around React and Vite. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** React's component model enables building reusable UI elements, making the code modular and maintainable.

2. **Efficient Development with Vite:** Vite is a build tool designed for speed. It provides a fast development server with instant hot module replacement (HMR), boosting developer productivity.

3. **Strong Linting:** ESLint, along with plugins for React and React Hooks, ensures code quality and adherence to best practices.

4. **CSS with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS:** Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach for rapidly styling components. PostCSS, combined with Autoprefixer, handles vendor prefixes for broader browser compatibility.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Core Technologies:**

  - **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **React DOM:** The bridge between React and the browser's DOM.
  - **Vite:** A fast development server and build tool.

- **Styling:**

  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
  - **PostCSS:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
  - **Autoprefixer:** A PostCSS plugin to automatically add vendor prefixes.

- **Additional Tools:**
  - **React Icons:** A library for including popular icons in React projects.
  - **React Markdown:** A component for rendering Markdown text within React.
  - **remark-gfm:** A plugin for React Markdown that adds support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, etc.).
  - **ESLint:** A linter for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
  - **ESLint Plugins:** Extensions to ESLint for specific environments (like React).
